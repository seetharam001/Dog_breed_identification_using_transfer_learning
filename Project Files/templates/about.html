                <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
                <p>
                    The first step involves collecting the Stanford Dogs dataset which contains
                    thousands of real-world dog images across multiple breeds. The images are cleaned,
                    resized to a uniform resolution and organized into training, validation and testing
                    sets. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, flipping and brightness
                    adjustments are applied to increase dataset diversity and help the model learn
                    robust visual features.

                <h3>Model Building</h3>
                <p>
                    The system uses Transfer Learning with the powerful VGG19 deep learning architecture.
                    Instead of training from scratch, the pre-trained convolutional layers are reused to
                    extract rich image features. Additional fully connected layers and dropout layers are
                    added to adapt the network specifically for dog breed classification and to reduce
                    overfitting.

                <h3>Model Training & Evaluation</h3>
                <p>
                    The model is trained using batches of augmented images to improve generalization.
                    During training, the network continuously updates its weights to minimize loss and
                    improve prediction accuracy. The performance is evaluated using validation accuracy,
                    loss curves and testing data to ensure the model performs reliably on unseen images.

                <h3>Model Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    After successful training, the model is integrated into a Flask web application.
                    The application provides an easy-to-use interface where users can upload dog images
                    and instantly receive breed predictions. This makes the deep learning model accessible
                    and usable in real-world scenarios through a simple and interactive web platform.
